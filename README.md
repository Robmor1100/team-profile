# Team Profile Generator


## Description

By providing a software engineering team's names, positions, and emails, this application can create an HTML file that displays all of their basic information in a simple yet clean webpage. The webpage also gives the viewer access to their emails and GitHub accounts.

## Installation

Clone the repository, do an 
```bash
npm i
```
 in your terminal to download the dependencies and write 
```bash 
node index.js 
```  
in your terminal to start the application. 


## Usage

 When the application starts, users will be asked questions inside their terminal. Answer and press enter to move on to the next question. After the last question is answered and the user presses enter, the application will create an HTML file with the whole Teamâ€™s information.


## Roadmap

I would like to add more CSS styling on the rendered HTML file so that the deployed file would look more visually appealing.
